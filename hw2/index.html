            <h2>Life Before Fame</h2>
            <p>Claire Elizabeth Cottril, also known by her stage name <em>Clairo</em>, was born on August 18, 1998 in Atlanta. She is the daughter of marketing executive Geoff Cottrill and Allie Cottrill, a photographer and designer. Clairo was born in Atlanta, Georgia, but only lived there until age 7. Her family briefly moved to Washington for three years, before finally settling into Carlisle, Massachusetts. Cottrill began recording covers on her laptop at the age of 13, beginning with a cover of a Maroon 5 song. In a 2015 interview with Rookie, she recalled of this first recording, "It took me hours to figure out if I wanted to post it on Facebook or not to even tell my friends that I'd made it. I was so nervous about it! I just closed my eyes and did it, and then I closed my computer and tried not to think about it". She performed cover songs at local businesses including Blue Dry Goods. MTV contacted her at the time to record a song to be used as background music for a television show on MTV, but the song was never aired. She began posting music to Bandcamp under the names Clairo and DJ Baby Benz while attending Concord-Carlisle High School in Concord, Massachusetts. She began posting covers, songs, and DJ mixes of rap music on SoundCloud. She also put three short films on an old YouTube channel and maintained a second channel for covers and short films.</p>

            <h2>First Song</h2>
            <p>Clairo first drew wide attention in late 2017 when the video for her song <strong>"Pretty Girl"</strong> went viral on YouTube.The song was recorded for an indie rock compilation benefiting the Transgender Law Center. According to her, she recorded the track "using the resources around me which were pretty s_. I used like a little keyboard that I had and I was really into '80s pop music-my mom is obsessed with it-so it kind of inspired me to do something like that." She attributes audience interest in the video to YouTube's algorithm system. The video was quickly put into the growing genre of bedroom pop and became popular on vaporwave-centric Facebook groups. "Pretty Girl" had amassed more than 110 million views on YouTube by 2024. This song eventually led to record deal, and she soon released her first EP, Diary 001. </p>

                    Charm seems to be a good in between what she always naturally seemed to be: a fun, melodic and minimalistic indie girl, and what she always meant to become: a powerful, experimental artist and composer. It feels to me like she did this fully for herself, not for the expectations, not for the recognition, but to share exactly how she was feeling at the moment.
