            <q>
                Charm seems to be a good in between what she always naturally seemed to be: a fun, melodic and minimalistic indie girl, and what she always meant to become: a powerful, experimental artist and composer. It feels to me like she did this fully for herself, not for the expectations, not for the recognition, but to share exactly how she was feeling at the moment.
